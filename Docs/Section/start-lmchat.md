# Start-LMChat
[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) is a free software which allows you to run and use publicly available Large Language Models at home.

One feature of LM Studio is a simple web server which provides an [OpenAI-compatible API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction). Not all capabilities in the OpenAI API are available in LM Studio as of the time of this writing (*07/2024*), and LM Studio uses a limited variation of the OpenAI API.
