## Manage History & Dialog Files
Dialog Files and the History File are important features for this module.

They enable the ability to continue, read or search a previous chat dialog with an LLM.

### Dialog Files

Each **Start-LMChat** session produces a **Dialog File** (*excluding when using Privacy Mode*).

Dialog Files are JSON-formatted records of interactions with LM Studio. They contain:
- Timestamped user and assistant interactions
- Creation/Modification timestamps
- Chat settings (temperature, max tokens, model, system prompt)
- User-defined Title and Tags

### History and Dialog Files

Dialog Files are not user-friendly, and can become numerous. A **History File** is used to make Dialog Files easier to manage.

The History File is an index containing an entry for each Dialog File. It stores identifying information about each Dialog File, such as:
- Creation/Modification timestamps
- The "opener" (first submitted user prompt)
- Title
- Tags
- Relative file path

The History File is used by **Start-LMChat** to select a prompt, and by several other functions.

The articles below detail different actions involving Dialog Files and/or the History File:
