## Manage History & Dialog Files
Dialog Files and the History File are important features for this module.

They enable the ability to continue, read or search a previous chat dialog with an LLM.

### Dialog Files

Each **Start-LMChat** session produces a **Dialog File** (*excluding when using Privacy Mode*).

Dialog Files are JSON-formatted records of interactions with LM Studio. They contain:
- Timestamped user and assistant interactions
- Creation/Modification timestamps
- Chat settings (temperature, max tokens, model, system prompt)
- User-defined Title and Tags

### History and Dialog Files

Dialog Files are not user-friendly, and can become numerous. A **History File** is used to make Dialog Files easier to manage.

The History File is **not** a repository of unique information: it is constructed entirely from the attributes of your Dialog Files:

- **Created**: Timestamp of when the Dialog File was created
- **Modified**: Timestamp of when the Dialog File was last modified
- **Title**: Title assigned to Dialog File via *Start-LMChat*
- **Opener**: The first user statement in the chat dialog
- **Model**: The last model used in the chat dialog
- **FilePath**: Relative path of the Dialog File
- **Tags**: Tags assigned to Dialog File via *Start-LMChat*

The History File is used by **Start-LMChat** to select a prompt, and by related functions involving Dialog Files.

The articles below detail different actions involving Dialog Files and/or the History File:
