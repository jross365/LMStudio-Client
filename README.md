## Documentation
This documentation assumes several prerequisites:
- LM Studio is running 
- The LM Studio web server is started in the software

The [Quick-Start Guide](./Docs/Section/Quick-Start-Guide.md) is a no-frills and no-explanations guide on getting the module up and running.

The [Full User Guide](./Docs/Section/Slow-Start-Guide.md) is an index of short articles on how to use the module.

I maintain a [Development Journal](./Docs/Dev-Journal.md) to record and track my priorities, and to rationalize my design decisions.

Last Docs update was **September 7, 2024**.
