- And more!
  - Seriously, there's a lot of functionality built into this module.
  - What these are and how to use them will be included in the documentation.


## Documentation

The [Quick-Start Guide](./Docs/Section/Quick-Start-Guide.md) is a no-frills and no-explanations guide on getting the module up and running.

It assumes several prerequisites:
- LM Studio is running 
- The LM Studio web server is started in the software

The [Slow-Start Guide](./Docs/Section/Slow-Start-Guide.md) is an index of more detailed documentation on how to use the module.

The Slow-Start Guide documentation is in the process of being written. Anything below "ðŸš§ **Below in progress:**" is not complete.

I maintain a [Development Journal](./Docs/Dev-Journal.md) to record and track my priorities, and to rationalize my design decisions.

It may be dry to some, and not dry to othres.

Last Update was **July 31, 2024**.

## Notes/Addendum:

**07/18/2024** I have created the PSD1 file so these functions can be imported as a proper Powershell module. See the [**dev journal**](./Docs/Dev-Journal.md) for details.

**07/07/2024** ~~The current version of the code does **not** work with Powershell 5. I will attempt to resolve this issue, and I'm not sure when it was first introduced.~~ This issue is caused by the use of the **clean {}** block in Powershell, which I learned was only introduced in 7.3.

I've commented out the **clean {}** block (for now).
